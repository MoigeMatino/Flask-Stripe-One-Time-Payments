    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:yourusername/flask-stripe-payments.git
    cd flask-stripe-payments
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    
    If you haven't installed Poetry yet, you can install it using the following command:
